                <p>The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.</p>
                <p>Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write
                    programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system
                    enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
                    convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically
                    typed,
                    compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.</p>

            <h3>A Tour of Go</h3>
            <article>
                <p>An interactive introduction to Go in three sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data
                    structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency
                    primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. You
                    can
                    take the tour online or install it locally with:</p>
                <code>$ go get golang.org/x/tour</code>
                <p>This will place the tour binary in your workspace's bin directory.</p>
                <h3>How to write Go code</h3>
                <p>Also available as a screencast, this doc explains how to use the go command to fetch, build, and
                    install
                    packages, commands, and run tests.</p>
                <code>package main
                        import "fmt"                        
                        func main() {
                            fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
                        }</code>
                <p>Create a file named wiki.go, open it in your favorite editor, and add the following lines:</p>

                                    "fmt"
                                    "io/ioutil"

                <h3>A Video Tour of Go</h3>
                <p>Three things that make Go fast, fun, and productive: interfaces, reflection, and concurrency. Builds
                    a
                    toy web crawler to demonstrate these.</p>
                <h3>Code that grows with grace</h3>
                <p>One of Go's key design goals is code adaptability; that it should be easy to take a simple design and
                    build upon it in a clean and natural way. In this talk Andrew Gerrand describes a simple "chat
                    roulette"
                    server that matches pairs of incoming TCP connections, and then use Go's concurrency mechanisms,
                    interfaces, and standard library to extend it with a web interface and other features. While the
                    function of the program changes dramatically, Go's flexibility preserves the original design as it
                    grows.</p>
                <h3>Go Concurrency Patterns</h3>
                <p>Concurrency is the key to designing high performance network services. Go's concurrency primitives
                    (goroutines and channels) provide a simple and efficient means of expressing concurrent execution.
                    In
                    this talk we see how tricky concurrency problems can be solved gracefully with simple Go code.</p>
                <h3>Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns</h3>
                <p>This talk expands on the Go Concurrency Patterns talk to dive deeper into Go's concurrency
                    primitives.
